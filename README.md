# Guitar-Hero-Bongo-Cat
A facecam for Guitar Hero with a bongo cat

# Installation
Assuming you don't have Python installed, head to python.org/download and install the latest version of Python.<br>
WHEN YOU RUN THE INSTALLER, REMEMBER TO CHECK "Add Python (version) to PATH".

# How to use
Run "program.pyw" and a Pygame window should show up.<br>
To access options, press the spacebar.<br><br>
The program should hopefully detect your Guitar Hero controller automatically. I only own an Xplorer so I can't test it with a Wii Les Paul or others. Report any issue you find with other guitars please!
<br>You can set the default streamer name in the first few lines of the python file. You can also just leave it empty for no name. I will add custom font support soon.
# Other things
If you find any bugs or glitches make sure to report them to the Issues page.<br>
Thanks for downloading!
